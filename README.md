# Introduction to C

A collection of C programs covering fundamental concepts of the C programming language — patterns, algorithms, functions, control flow, arrays, pointers, data structures, and more.
<br>
This repository serves as a learning reference for beginners learning C and a place to practice C skills.

## 📚 What’s Inside

This project includes many example C programs such as:
```
- Basic input/output programs
- Control structures (loops, conditions)
- Functions & recursion
- Arrays and sorting/searching
- Patterns & pyramids
- Algorithms (GCD/LCM, Fibonacci, factorial)
- Simple utilities like palindrome, prime check, calculator, etc.
- Operations on singly linked list (adding, deleting nodes, traversing and reversing)
```
Each `.c` file represents a standalone program demonstrating a unique concept.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

✔ Variables and Data Types  
✔ Control Flow (`if`, `switch`, loops)  
✔ Functions and Recursion  
✔ Arrays and Strings  
✔ Sorting & Searching  
✔ Pointers & Memory  
✔ Modular Programming  
✔ Menu-based utilities and pattern printing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a C compiler like **GCC** installed. For Windows you can use **MinGW** or **WSL**.

To check if GCC is installed:

```bash
gcc --version
